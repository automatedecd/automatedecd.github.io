									Introduction
								</button>
								<div class="content">

									<p>
										The Philippine Early Childhood Development (Phil. ECD) Checklist is designed
										for service providers like teachers, rural health midwives, child development
										and day care workers, parents/caregivers who can easily administer after a
										brief training period. By using the checklist, they will be able to determine if a
										child is developing adequately, or is at risk for developmental delays.
									</p>
									<p>
										This Checklist is NOT intended to be used to 1) make a medical diagnosis;
										2) determine a child’s intelligence quotient or IQ; or 3) gauge his academic
										achievement. It is only the first of several steps in a comprehensive assessment
										process that a child at risk is expected to go through so he can get the help he
										needs as early as possible.

									</p>
									<p>
										The Checklist consists of a Child’s Record, divided into two parts: Child’s
										Record 1 for children aged 0 months to 3.0 years; Child Record 2 is for
										children aged 3 years and 1 month to 5 years and 11 months. The items in
										the Checklist are grouped into seven domains: 1) gross motor, 2) fine motor,
										3) self-help, 4) receptive language, 5) expressive language, 6) cognitive, and
										7) social-emotional. The Child Record 2 will be utilized for the kindergarten
										learners of the Department of Education.
									</p>
									<p>
										The choice of items was based on statistical validation while the test has been
										normed based on a sample of 10,915 children from the NCR, III, VI, VII, VIII,
										and XII.
									</p>
									<p>
										The Checklist is thus a product of careful refinement and validation. It is a
										monitoring tool suited to the needs of the Filipino child.

									</p>
									<p>
										We hope that this Checklist will serve as a valuable tool not only in monitoring
										the Filipino child’s growth and development but also in ensuring that he or
										she enjoys a care and nurturing environment, thus assuring him or her of a
										secure tomorrow.

									</p>

									Testing Considerations
								</button>
								<div class="content">
									<h3>Physical Conditions</h3>
									<p>
										The Checklist can be administered in a setting familiar to the respondents.
										Ideally, the place should be relatively quiet, well lighted and ventilated, and
										have a table and chairs to provide comfortable conditions for the respondents
										and examiner.
									</p>
									<p>
										If conducted outdoors and there is no table, any flat work surface will suffice.
									</p>
									<h3>Standard Procedures</h3>
									<p>
										The examiner can employ various methods to determine if the child exhibits
										specified behaviour. These include observation, direct elicitation of the
										behaviour from the child, and also interview of the parents(s) or caregiver(s).
										<br>
										When interviewing the parents(s) or caregiver(s), the examiner may wish to
										use the opportunity to ask them what activities they do at home to stimulate
										the development of their child. Their responses can be recorded on a separate
										sheet.
										<br>
										Older children aged 2.6 years and above may be tested in small groups of
										2-3 similarly aged youngsters if the examiner feels this will make them more
										responsive to her queries and request. This especially if they have not had
										any day care or pre-school experience.
									</p>
									<h3>Administration Time</h3>
									<p>
										Each form of the revised ECD Checklist should not take more than 45 minutes to administer.
									</p>
									<h3>Fundamentals in Administration</h3>
									<p>
										Rapport-building is very important, especially when the child is not familiar
										with the examiner. So be sure to spend a few minutes interacting with the
										child by playing or chatting with him. It may help when the items, which
										involve interviewing the parents / caregiver, are administered first with the
										child nearby. This will make him realize that the examiner is a kind, caring
										person and facilitate the rapport-building process.
										<br>
										The examiner must emphasize that there are neither right or wrong answers
										nor good or bad scores. This will assure greater accuracy in what parents/
										caregivers report and decrease the incidence of a child's giving an answer
										based on what the others in the group have said.
										<br>
										The examiner must refrain from “teaching” the correct answer because this
										Checklist is intended to be given to the same child at a later point in time. If
										the child has been taught the answer, it will be difficult to determine if his
										success was due to this or to his expected maturation.
										<br>
										Answer that do not seem to exactly correspond to the intent of an item are
										to be written in the “Comments” column of the tool. These can serve as
										reference points of a child's progress when the checklist is administered to
										him again at a later date.

									</p>
									<h3>Testing Materials</h3>
									<p>
										Form 2 Materials:
										<br>&nbsp • 2 clean small toys
										<br>&nbsp• 2 balls
										<br>&nbsp• food: bread, biscuit, raisins, individually wrapped candy

									<p>This checklist should be administered to the child at two intervals: upon entry
										to and end of the kindergarten program. Instructions are provided in filling
										out each table.
										<br>
										After verifying the dates, compute the child's age by subtracting the date he
										was born from the date the test was administered. Write the examiner's name
										for each test administration.

									Introducing the Philippine Early Childhood Development Checklist
								</button>
								<div class="content">
									<img src="blog-images/technical-manual/3.jpg">
									<p>
										Introduce the Checklist to the parent/ caregiver by saying the following:
										<br><br>
										<i>
											We are here to help you find out how your child is developing by asking
											you some questions about the thing he is able to do or having your child
											do some activities. There is no pass or fail score. This is just a checklist.
											Some of the questions are for children older than your child so I do not
											expect him to be able to do all the things I will be asking.
											We plan to administer this Checklist two times: upon entry to kindergarten
											and at the end of the school year. So please do not teach or coach him
											because it is important to know just what he can and what he still cannot
											do at this age.
											<br><br>
											Later on we will share the results with you and give suggestions on what
											else you can do to stimulate your child's development.
										</i>

									Completing the Record Forms
								</button>
								<div class="content">
									<p>
										The front page of the Checklist includes the portion of the sociodemographic
										information of the child that must be filled out completely.
										Compute the child's age by subtracting the date he was born from the test
										that was administered.
									</p>
									<pre>
									<table>  
										<tr>
											<td>For example: </td><td>Date of  Exam:</td><td> 2001 – 03 – 12      </td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>             </td><td>Date of Birth:</td><td><u> 1998 – 05 – 17 </u></td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>             </td><td>              </td><td>    2 – 09 – 25    </td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>             </td><td>              </td><td>  ( Y – M – D )    </td>
										</tr>

									</table>
									</pre>
									<p>
										Hence, in this example the child's age is 2.9 years. There is no rounding oﬀ.
										Please note that each month consists of 30 days.
									</p>

									<h3>Domains</h3>
									<p>
										The Checklist is divided into 7 domains: Gross Motor, Fine Motor, Self-Help,
										Receptive Language, Expressive Language, Cognitive and Social-Emotional.
									</p>

									<h3>How to Administer the Items</h3>
									<p>
										The column labeled “Materials/ Procedure” gives specific instructions on
										how to observe the child or elicit the required responses, as well as some
										criteria on how to score the responses.
										<br>
										If the behaviour or response is present, place a check ( √ ) in the “PRESENT”
										column. If the behaviour or response is not yet present / observed, indicate
										this via a hyphen ( - ).
										<br>
										The examiner may demonstrate skills in the Gross Motor, Fine Motor and
										Self-Help domains to make sure the child understands the instructions.
										However, unless otherwise specified, items in the Receptive Language,
										Expressive Language, Cognitive, and Social-Emotional domains should not
										be demonstrated. Some items indicate that the parental report will suffice.
										Other items indicate that the skill must be elicited by the examiner. For other
										items where neither of these has been specified, the examiner must try to
										elicit the skill. The examiner may ask the parent/ caregiver if a skill is present
										or absent only when she is in doubt about the child’s ability to display the
										skill, like if the child is not willing to respond/ perform because he is shy or
										not in the mood. If the child tries to do what is being asked but does not
										succeed, it is scored as “Not Present” (-).
										<br>
										Any observation or comment regarding a specific item or the response of the
										child may be written in the last column labeled “Comments”. Examples of
										such remarks include: item is not applicable; lack of opportunity, response
										was not displayed 2 out of 3 trials, etc.
									</p>

									<h3>Where to Start and Where to Stop</h3>
									<p>
										Administer all the items.
									</p>

									<h3>Teaching and giving feedback</h3>
									<p>
										The examiner must be careful not to teach the item or allow the parent/
										caregiver to prompt the child. Also be careful not to make comments like
										“correct”’ “very good”, “wrong”’ etc. or show via facial expressions or
										gestures that a child is doing well or not very well. However, you can praise
										the child for his eﬀorts by saying things like “good job” even if he does not
										succeed with the item. This will help him maintain his interest in the diﬀerent
										activities you are asking him to do.

									</p>
									<h3>Eliciting Behaviour</h3>
									<p>
										Sometimes the child can actually do an activity but just needs a little coaxing.
										In such instances, gently encourage the child to give the task a try and remind
										him that he is not expected to succeed all the time.
										Make sure you avoid the following:
										<br>
										<br>&nbsp • Making remarks that will embarrass or humiliate the child like, “You
										are so big already and you still do not know how to do that?”
										<br>&nbsp • Comparing him to his friends or other children in the group.
										<br>&nbsp • Threatening him if he does not comply like saying, “I will tell your
										mommy that you do not want to do what I am asking you.”
									</p>
									<h3>Deferring the Evaluation</h3>
									<p>
										The evaluation may be deferred for another day for the following reasons:
										<br>
										<br>&nbsp • The child is sick and not feeling well.
										<br>&nbsp • The child is crying and not disposed to cooperate.
									</p>
									<h3>How to score</h3>
									<ol>
										<li>Tally the number of check marks (√) in each domain and record all this in
											the section labeled “Total Score”. The check marks (√) that you tallied in
											each domain are the raw scores.

									<h3>Deriving the Standard Score or Development Index</h3>
									<p>
										Add the Scaled Score of each of the seven domains. This is called the sum
										of the Scaled Scores. Theoretically the sum cannot be less than 7 or more
										than 133. Refer to the Table of Standard Scores below. Locate the Sum of
										Scaled Scores that you arrived at, and then find the corresponding Standard
										Score for this which is printed in the column labelled “Standard Scores
