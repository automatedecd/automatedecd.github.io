					<h1>About</h1>
					<h2>We Innovate through Technology</h2>
					<p>The Project AUTOMATEDECD  was conceptualized by Joselito Timbad, ICT District 
				      Officer/Coordinator of La Castellana-I. This project aims to develop tools such as Excel Templates and application programs
					  that can be utilized by Kinder teachers to perform thier work the most efficient way. The main tool that was developed from this 
					  project was called ECD E-Tool. The first version of the tool was an XLSX file format. Years later, Christopher Biona and Joe Ed Mialen joined the
					  project. Since then, the tool was further refined and improved the automation process with the 
				      implemention of VBA Excel ,a programming language for Excel task automation. The team continues to innovate and build tools in aid to their colleague
					  in their workplace. The team has learned a lot as it continues to develop thier project. 
				      The developers of the ECD e-Tool were all DepEd teachers who understand the nature Kidergarten Teachers teaching job and 
				      know how this tool can be utilized and useful on the part of the teachers. The ECD E-Tool was designed and 
				      developed with its core functionalities based on the Revised Philippine Early Childhood Development Checklist.
					 The tool is completely free of charge.</p>
